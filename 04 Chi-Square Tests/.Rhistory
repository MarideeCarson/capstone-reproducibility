### Below will be a table of gender versus majors in engineering or psychology ###
### Chi Square Test ###
$ gender: Factor w/ 2 levels "female","male": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 ... ###
### 'data.frame':	60 obs. of  2 variables:
$ major : Factor w/ 2 levels "engineering",..: 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 ...
### $ major : Factor w/ 2 levels "engineering",..: 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 ...###

#        engineering psychology#
# female          11         18 #
#male            19         12 #
### X^2(1) = 2.4, p = .12 so gender and major are unrelated
